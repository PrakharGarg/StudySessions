2.) Grading Level:
  - Same grade for all members
  
3.) Differences
  - We were unable to connect with UT's system due to restricted access, so the app cannot reserve rooms or scrape UT's registrar for classes. 
  - We decided against having a feature for repeated study sessions, since we did not want to clutter the home screen with a huge list of repeated events. We also did not know how we would stop the event from repeating forever. 
  - We also decided not to implement social media integration as we wanted the app to be self-contained and have all of the event info located in the app itself. 
  - Lastly, we decided cloning an event was unnecessary, as the title, time, and location would have to be changed anyways. 
  
4.) Special Instructions 
  - Use Xcode 8.1 with Swift 3 Compiler 
  - The first login may take a while due to Heroku instance "waking up"
