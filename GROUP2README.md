    Creating a Study Session View

2.) Grading Level:
  - Same grade for all members
  
3.) Differences
  - We got rid of push notifications due to back-end difficulties, and the inability to test this functionality. We also removed linking the app with UT's Canvas OAuth, since we, as students, do not have access to this. 
  
  - We added, a news-feed-esque home screen that shows all Study Sessions that have been created for the user's classes. 
4.) Special Instructions 
  - Use Xcode 8 with Swift 3 Compiler 
  - The first login may take a while due to Heroku instance "waking up"
  - The toggle in the Home Screen is currently inactive and will not affect the Home Screen at all.
